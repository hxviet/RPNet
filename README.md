# RPNet

This project implements the deep learning model RPNet proposed by Xu et al. (EECV 2018) for localizing and recognizing characters on Chinese car license plates. The Chinese City Parking Dataset as updated in 2019 is used for training and testing the model.

For details on the neural network architecture and the dataset, please refer to the authors' paper at https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01261-8_16.
